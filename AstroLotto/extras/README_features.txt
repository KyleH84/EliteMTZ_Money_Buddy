AstroLotto Features Defaults
Created: 2025-09-05T19:26:50

This package adds default feature flags so existing pages don't hide controls when the flags file is missing.
Files included:
- AstroLotto/extras/features.json
- AstroLotto/extras/v14_flags.json

Keys set to True (with synonyms):
- training_enabled / enable_training / training
- show_admin_tools / admin_tools
- enable_health_scan

After copying, restart the app or click any 'Reload' button in the UI.
