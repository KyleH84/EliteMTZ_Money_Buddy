    "RSI": "Relative Strength Index: 0â€“100 momentum scale. Low = oversold; high = overbought.",
    "RSI2": "2â€‘day RSI: very short-term RSI used for quick meanâ€‘reversion bounces.",
    "RSI4": "4â€‘day RSI: slightly slower shortâ€‘term RSI.",
    "ConnorsRSI": "Larry Connors composite (RSI(3), streak RSI(2), and 100â€‘day percentile of daily return). Lower = better for bounces.",
    "RelSPY": "Relative strength vs SPY: >0 means the stock outperformed SPY over the lookback.",
    "PctFrom200d": "Percent distance from 200â€‘day moving average. >0 = above longâ€‘term trend.",
    "ATR": "Average True Range: typical daily range; a proxy for volatility.",
    "RVOL": "Relative Volume: todayâ€™s volume vs 20â€‘day average. 1.0 = normal; 2.0 = 2Ã— normal.",
    "SqueezeHint": "Compression flag based on recent narrow ranges. 1 = compressed; can pop.",
    "CrowdRisk": "How crowded/obvious the setup looks (RVOL + near highs). Higher = more chase risk.",
    "RetailChaseRisk": "Proxy for retail chase (very hot RSI + high RVOL). Higher = more likely to fade.",
    "P_up": "Model probability the stock goes up (given current features).",
    "Combined": "The score BreakoutBuddy ranks by. Starts from P_up then applies bonuses/penalties (e.g., regime, crowd).",
    "FinalScore": "Legacy alias for the rank score; prefer 'Combined'.",
    "Universe size": "How many symbols to scan from a liquid preset list. Larger = slower.",
    "NL filters": "Naturalâ€‘language filters like: rsi2<5 and price<20 and rel>0. Aliases: price/close, rel=RelSPY, rvol, atr, crowd, retail, squeeze, pct200.",

    "Î”t (dt)": "Forecast window (seconds). Effective horizon youâ€™re targeting (e.g., 30m, 2h, EOD).",
    "Îµ (epsilon)": "Finiteâ€‘difference step (in days) used to estimate time sensitivity (âˆ‚score/âˆ‚t).",
    "âˆ‚score/âˆ‚t": "Sensitivity of the score w.r.t. time. Heuristic in BB uses RelSPY, RVOL, RSI(4), and ChangePct.",
    "Î”t_K (dt_K)": "Kozyrev timeâ€‘shift term: Î”t_K = Îº Â· h Â· (1/Î”t âˆ’ 1/Î”tâ‚€). The correction applies (âˆ‚score/âˆ‚t)Â·Î”t_K.",

    "AUC": "Area under ROC; higher is better. Good for thresholdâ€‘free ranking quality.",
    "MSE": "Mean Squared Error; for regressionâ€‘style targets. Lower is better.",
